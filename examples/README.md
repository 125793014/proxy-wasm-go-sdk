Theses are the proxy-wasm-go reimplementation of examples in https://github.com/proxy-wasm/proxy-wasm-rust-sdk/tree/master/examples.

Before you try an example, you must install tinygo(0.12.0 or above) for compiling your programs to wasm binary.
Please follow the official instruction [here](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/macos/).

Currently they are tested against `docker.io/istio/proxyv2:1.5.0` image.s
